# SMorph

This library automates the morphological analysis of cells and classify
different subgroups based on the extracted morphometric parameters.

- The notebook [single_cell_analysis.ipynb](./single_cell_analysis_mg.ipynb)
includes the morpholgy analysis to explore various morphological parameters of a
single cell.

## Latest version usage

## Quickstart

The package can be easily used in local and Colaboratory environment.

### Colaboratory

Just go to following for:

- Single cell analysis: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/swanandlab/SMorph/blob/main/single_cell_analysis.ipynb)

- Group Cells analysis: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/swanandlab/SMorph/blob/main/group_analysis.ipynb)

You'll have to upload you data to *Colaboratory* environment either directly to
session storage or to your *Google Drive*.

Instructions for linking your *Google Drive* dataset:

- Either select `Mount Drive` from sidebar `Files` browser or manually execute
the following code in a cell.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

- After completing the authorization, paste the authorization code in the input.

- After confirmation, refresh the *Files* sidebar. Your drive would now be
visible in it.

- Follow the same instructions in the following ***Usage*** instructions for
organization of your data.

The same notebook can also run on your local environment.

## Installation from source

The code has been tested for Python 3.7.11 and above, if you don't have it
installed, please download the binaries from
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
follow the installation guide.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
poetry install
```

If the above commands throw errors on windows, please try:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

desired notebook using browser.

```sh
poetry shell
jupyter notebook
```

If the above command throw errors on windows, please try:

```sh
poetry shell
python -m notebook
```

## Usage

### Group analysis

- Place your image data folders inside the `Datasets` folder, with each group's
images organized in their respective folders.

- Run the analysis by replacing the value of `groups_folders` variable in
`group_analysis.ipynb` with path to each of your cell groups.

### Single cell analysis

- Run the analysis by replacing the value of `cell_image` variable in
`single_cell_analysis.ipynb` with path to your cell image.
